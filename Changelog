	* Implemented the Template “Keep” mode. This allows to save a template in such a way that when it get's used only the style definitions get copied to the actual table but not any information about the number of rows and their content: Content stays - Style changes.

	* Fixed a small issue which caused locked fields to not be set/locked properly.

2005-07-29  Bernhard Kraft <kraftb@think-open.at>

	* Fixed a bug which resulted in not being able to save RTE content. This bug occured only when creating new tables with version 0.2.0 because of the change that the RTE editor is only included when needed.

2005-07-23  Bernhard Kraft <kraftb@think-open.at>

	* Introduced “Fast-Mode” which stores the cell properties in a serialized array. This increases speed but cell properties can't get edited from the T3 record editing screen anymore but rather from the table wizard. Also the RTE fields now only get inserted into the Flexform when RTE Mode is switched on. This also increases speed.
	* For more information on Fast mode see section “Fast mode” in the documentation.
